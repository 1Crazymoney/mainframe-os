The initial MFT token utility implementation in Mainframe OS will include:
- Dapp submission for Mainframe OS Suggested Apps
- Gas price of underlying incentivized decentralized services (Swarm, etc)
- Proactive contact outreach (i.e. cold-calling)

Mainframe is also exploring potential implementation of token utility including:
- Subscription models for Apps and Developers
- Dapp deploy/auto-updates

As we evaluate these options and challenges, Mainframe continues to be dedicated to a frictionless experience for users of our platform.
