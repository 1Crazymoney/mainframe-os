title: MFT integration
---

Mainframe tokens (**MFT**) are integrated in Mainframe OS to power underlying services. In this initial release, users can stake **MFT** to send invitations to other users to connect.

We plan on allowing developers to stake **MFT** to submit their apps to be included in the Mainframe App Store. We are also exploring subscription models for app users and developers, facilitating in-app purchases or upgrades, and tiered/paid apps, all powered by **MFT**.

As additional underlying services are enhanced to include incentivization functionality, **MFT** will be integrated more and more to power those services and create a seamless experience for users. Mainframe continues to be dedicated to a frictionless experience for users of our platform.
