title: Welcome to Mainframe OS
---

Mainframe OS is an integrated web3 platform for unstoppable apps, with built in data ownership and security enforcement.

It allows individuals to securely store their data, and only make it accessible to others (contacts, apps or publicly) as they decide to do so rather than having to trust a third-party provider.

To achieve this, Mainframe OS uses a decentralized infrastructure consisting of:

- [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/), the leading public smart contracts blockchain for global consensus (payments and smart contracts).
- [Swarm](https://swarm.ethereum.org/) for decentralized storage and communications.
- Custom protocols on top of Ethereum and Swarm to support contacts and apps.

You can learn more about the [core features of Mainframe OS](core-features.md) or go directly to the [getting started guide](getting-started.md) for installation and first steps instructions.

If you are a developer interested in developing applications for Mainframe OS, make sure to read the [application development documentation](app-development.md).

## Security disclaimer

Mainframe OS and its ecosystem are still in early stages of development. As such, bugs and other issues (including security ones) are to be expected.

We hope to attract early adopters to Mainframe OS but cannot make any promise about the security, privacy and availability of the data Mainframe OS interacts with.

> Do not use Mainframe OS with sensitive data.
